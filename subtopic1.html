        <tr><th>Abstract: This peer reviewed journal article written by Linda K. Kaye, Anastasia Rousaki, Laura C. Joyner, Laura A.F. Barrett, and Lisa J. Orchard describes the relationship between human  behaviors and communication in computer-mediated spaces like social media and other online platforms. The article focuses on computer-mediated communication or CMC which is a theory that uses the cyberpsychological perspective to understand online behaviors and interactions. The article goes on to break down an original taxonomy that the authors created to define three types of behaviors that consisted of the Online-exclusive behaviors, Online-mediated behavior, and Online-recorded behavior. The three behavior types categorize interactions individuals have with the digital world that can later be used to compare, research, and further analyze.
